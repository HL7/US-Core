canonical: 'http://hl7.org/fhir/us/core'
introduction: |+
  The US Core Implementation Guide defines the minimum set of FHIR RESTful
  interactions for each of the US Core Profiles to access patient data. The US
  Core Profiles are informed by the prior Data Access Framework and the
  [Argonaut DSTU2](https://www.fhir.org/guides/argonaut/r2/) Implementation
  Guides. The profiles here are stand alone and support the latest requirements
  from [ONC U.S. Core Data for Interoperability
  (USCDI)](https://www.healthit.gov/isa/united-states-core-data-interoperability-uscdi).
  Fixes required between releases are managed by the [Cross Group Project patch
  process](https://confluence.hl7.org/display/CGP/US+Core+%27Patch%27+Process)
  with approved patches on
  [confluence](https://confluence.hl7.org/display/CGP/Approved+Patches+and+Additional+Guidance).
  For a detailed list of the changes between versions, see the [Change Notes](
