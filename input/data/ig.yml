    -   description: "This operation is used to return all the references to documents\
            \ related to a patient. \n\n The operation requires a patient id and takes\
            \ the optional input parameters: \n  - start date\n  - end date\n  - document\
            \ type \n\n and returns a [Bundle](http://hl7.org/fhir/bundle.html) of\
            \ type \"searchset\" containing [DocumentReference](http://hl7.org/fhir/documentreference.html)\
            \ resources for the patient. The DocumentReference resources **SHOULD**\
            \ conform to the [US Core DocumentReference\n Profiles](http://hl7.org/fhir/us/core/StructureDefinition/us-core-documentreference).\
            \ If the server has or can create documents that are related to the patient,\
            \ and that are available for the given user, the server returns the DocumentReference\
            \ resources needed to support the records.  The principle intended use\
            \ for this operation is to provide a provider or patient with access to\
            \ their available document information. \n\n This operation is *different*\
            \ from a search by patient and type and date range because: \n\n 1. It\
            \ is used to request a server *generate* a document based on the specified\
            \ parameters. \n\n 1. If no parameters are specified, the server SHALL\
            \ return a DocumentReference to the patient's most current CCD \n\n 1.\
            \ If the server cannot *generate* a document based on the specified parameters,\
            \ the operation will return an empty search bundle. \n\n This operation\
            \ is the *same* as a FHIR RESTful search by patient,type and date range\
            \ because: \n\n 1. References for *existing* documents that meet the requirements\
            \ of the request SHOULD also be returned unless the client indicates they\
            \ are only interested in 'on-demand' documents using the *on-demand* parameter."

description: 'The US Core Implementation Guide is based on FHIR Version R4 and defines
    the minimum conformance requirements for accessing patient data. The Argonaut
    pilot implementations, ONC 2015 Edition Common Clinical Data Set (CCDS), and ONC
    U.S. Core Data for Interoperability (USCDI) v1 provided the requirements for this
    guide. The prior Argonaut search and vocabulary requirements, based on FHIR DSTU2,
    are updated in this guide to support FHIR Version R4. This guide was used as the
    basis for further testing and guidance by the Argonaut Project Team to provide
    additional content and guidance specific to Data Query Access for purpose of ONC
    Certification testing. These profiles are the foundation for future US Realm FHIR
    implementation guides. In addition to Argonaut, they are used by DAF-Research,
    QI-Core, and CIMI. Under the guidance of HL7 and the HL7 US Realm Steering Committee,
    the content will expand in future versions to meet the needs specific to the US
    Realm.

    These requirements were originally developed, balloted, and published in FHIR
    DSTU2 as part of the Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information
    Technology (ONC) sponsored Data Access Framework (DAF) project. For more information
    on how DAF became US Core see the US Core change notes.'
