description: 'The US Core Implementation Guide is based on FHIR Version R4 and defines
  the minimum conformance requirements for accessing patient data. The Argonaut pilot
  implementations, ONC 2015 Edition Common Clinical Data Set (CCDS), and ONC U.S.
  Core Data for Interoperability (USCDI) v1 provided the requirements for this guide.
  The prior Argonaut search and vocabulary requirements, based on FHIR DSTU2, are
  updated in this guide to support FHIR Version R4. This guide was used as the basis
  for further testing and guidance by the Argonaut Project Team to provide additional
  content and guidance specific to Data Query Access for purpose of ONC Certification
  testing. These profiles are the foundation for future US Realm FHIR implementation
  guides. In addition to Argonaut, they are used by DAF-Research, QI-Core, and CIMI.
  Under the guidance of HL7 and the HL7 US Realm Steering Committee, the content will
  expand in future versions to meet the needs specific to the US Realm.

  These requirements were originally developed, balloted, and published in FHIR DSTU2
  as part of the Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology
  (ONC) sponsored Data Access Framework (DAF) project. For more information on how
  DAF became US Core see the US Core change notes.'
