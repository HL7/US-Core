This Implementation Guide uses the [Vital Signs Profile] formal definitions from the FHIR [Observation] resource. However, this Implementation Guide provides the following additional guidance which sets the minimum expectations for recording, searching and fetching vital signs associated with a patient. Together they identify which elements, extensions, vocabularies and value sets **SHALL** be present in the resource when using this profile.

**Example Usage Scenarios:**

The following are example usage scenarios for the Vital Signs
Profile:

-   Query for vital signs of a particular patient
-   Record vital signs of a particular patient

###### Mandatory Data Elements and Terminology


The following data-elements must always be present ([Mandatory] definition). These are presented below in a simple human-readable explanation.  Profile specific guidance and examples are provided as well.  The [**Formal Profile Definition**](#profile) are provided as links in the table below to view the formal summary, definitions, and  terminology requirements.  

**Each Observation must have:**

1.  a status
1.  a category code of 'vital-signs'
1.  a LOINC code which tells you what is being measured and is taken from the “LOINC Code” column in the table below.
    -   note: If a more specific code is recorded, the generic code and the translated coded must be sent - e.g. method specific LOINC Codes, SNOMED CT concepts, system specific codes
1.  a patient
1.  a time indicating when the measurement was taken
1.  a numeric result value and standard UCUM unit which is taken from the “UCUM Unit Code” column in the table below.
    -   note: if there is no numeric result then you have to supply a reason

**Profile specific implementation guidance:**

* This table represents a minimum set of vital sign concepts, the required LOINC codes, and UCUM units of measure codes used for representing vitals signs observations (See the [General Guidance Section] for further guidance on using UCUM). These are [extensible] bindings and require that when a system support of any of these vital signs concepts, they must represent them using these codes. In addition, if you have a blood pressure observation, you must have both a systolic and a diastolic component, though one or both may have dataAbsentReason instead of a value.

* This profile may be referenced by different capability statements, such as the [Conformance requirements for the US Core Server].

* Alternate codes may be provided in addition to the standard LOINC and UCUM codes defined here.The examples illustrate using other codes as translations.

* Other profiles may make rules about which vital sign must be present or must be present as part of a panel.
