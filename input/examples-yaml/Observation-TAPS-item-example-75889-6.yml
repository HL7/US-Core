    This term was created for, but not limited in use to, an electronic Clinical Quality
    Measure (eCQM) to be used in the CMS EHR Incentive Program for Meaningful Use.
    The eCQM allows for multiple ways to screen for alcohol misuse, including AUDIT-C
    [LOINC: 75626-2] or one of two questions that assess whether the patient consumes
    alcohol [LOINC: 75855-7] and the frequency of heavy drinking days (this LOINC).
    The LOINC for five (5) or more drinks per day is [LOINC: 88037-7].'
