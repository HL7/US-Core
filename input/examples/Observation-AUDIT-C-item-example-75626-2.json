A score of 4 or more for men and 3 or more for women is considered positive for hazardous drinking or active alcohol use disorders. If the points are all from Question 1 alone where 2 and 3 are 0, it is likely the patient is drinking below recommended limits. The care provider may review the patients alcohol intake over that past few months to confirm accuracy. [PMID: 12695273]"
