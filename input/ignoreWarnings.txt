# ===  4 ERRORS Discussed on FMG IG review and variance granted 7.0.0  ===
# ===========================================================-=====================

# === Added this STU NOTE: This profile is technically non-conformant with the base FHIR ver 4.0.1 vitals profile which defines a required binding that excludes the concept for L/min for Observation.component.value(x). This is a known issue and it means validation errors may occur when validating against this version of the US Core Pulse Oximetry Profile. This has been corrected in base FHIR ver 4.3.0 (“Release 4B”) which will correct this error when this guide is based a newer version of FHIR. ===

ERROR: Observation/satO2-fiO2: Observation.component[0].value.ofType(Quantity): The code provided (http://unitsofmeasure.org#L/min) was not found in the value set 'Vital Signs Units' (http://hl7.org/fhir/ValueSet/ucum-vitals-common|4.0.1), and a code from this value set is required: The provided code 'http://unitsofmeasure.org#L/min' was not found in the value set 'http://hl7.org/fhir/ValueSet/ucum-vitals-common|4.0.1'
ERROR: US Core Vital Signs Profile.Observation.component.value[x]: illegal attempt to change the binding on Observation.component.value[x] from required to extensible

# ==== This is a known issue with the terminology service - there is no timeline for their resolution ===

# =========================================================================================

# === US Core Goal Description Binding is extensible which allow for text only and guidance to use free text for Goal.description is given in the US Core Goal Implementation Guidance (1). There are 2 Goal examples, Goal/goal-sdoh-2 uses a code this one does not. ===

No code provided, and a code should be provided from the value set 'US Core Goal Codes' (http://hl7.org/fhir/us/core/ValueSet/us-core-goal-description|7.0.0)

# === Circular US Core Warnings since this is US Core (4): NONE ===


# === Several examples derived from this profile are provided in this guide (1) ===

WARNING: StructureDefinition.where(url = 'http://hl7.org/fhir/us/core/StructureDefinition/us-core-vital-signs'): The Implementation Guide contains no examples for this profile

# === These questionnaires are created using NLM tooling based on LOINC LFORMs.  They use standard FHIR Questionnaire Extensions that "extend" the base SDC profile ===

This element does not match any known slice defined in the profile http://hl7.org/fhir/uv/sdc/StructureDefinition/sdc-questionnaire|3.0.0

# === Code from extensibly bound to NUCC for US Core and not from base FHIR preferred c80-practice-codes valueset (1)===

None of the codings provided are in the value set 'Practice Setting Code Value Set' (http://hl7.org/fhir/ValueSet/c80-practice-codes|4.0.1), and a coding is recommended to come from this value set) (codes = http://nucc.org/provider-taxonomy#208D00000X)

# === The following comment is understood and acknowledged.  In some cases it inherits binding from core and A change request to correct this has been applied to the base FHIR ver 4.3.0 (“Release 4B”) to clarify the binding applies to the Quantity data type. Will need to slice value[x] in future ===

The element Observation.value[x] has a binding, and has multiple types subject to bindings ([dateTime, boolean, string, SampledData, Quantity, Period, Ratio, integer, time, Range, CodeableConcept]). The binding will apply to all the types
INFORMATION: StructureDefinition/us-core-vital-signs: StructureDefinition.differential.element[14].binding: The element Observation.component.value[x] has a binding, and has multiple types subject to bindings ([dateTime, boolean, string, SampledData, Quantity, Period, Ratio, integer, time, Range, CodeableConcept]). The binding will apply to all the types


# ==== The following content is inherited from the base standard and cannot be changed ====

The markdown contains content that appears to be an embedded HTML tag starting at 'Th'. This will (or SHOULD) be escaped by the presentation layer. The content should be checked to confirm that this is the desired behaviour
The string value contains text that looks like embedded HTML tags. If this content is rendered to HTML without appropriate post-processing, it may be a security risk

# ==== The pattern is set in a repeating slice.  The pattern is expected to hold for all repetitions of that slice.  (It's fixing the 'system' for the identifier.) ====

INFORMATION: StructureDefinition/us-core-organization: StructureDefinition.snapshot.element[18].pattern.ofType(Identifier): The repeating element has a pattern. The pattern will apply to all the repeats (this has not been clear to all users)

# ==== The self link for these searchset bundle is to the $docref operation and not a search ====

No types could be determined from the search string, so the types can''t be checked

# === Using the extension US Core Extension Questionnaire URI  pointing to a pdf form of the Questionnaire for this example.  Regarding the message: "No questionnaire is identified, so no validation can be performed against the base questionnaire" ===

INFORMATION: QuestionnaireResponse/glascow-coma-score: QuestionnaireResponse: No questionnaire is identified, so no validation can be performed against the base questionnaire

# ===  The following Warning is understood and the invariant reviewed. The type specified in ofType is Quantity *is* a possible candidate for the existing types of value[x]. This invariant has been tested in the FHIRPath tester and is intended as written ===


# ===  The following Warning is understood and the invariant reviewed. The type specified in ofType is CodeableConcept *is* a possible candidate for the existing types of value[x]. This invariant has been tested in the FHIRPath tester and is intended as written ===


# === This Search Parameter expression `[Type].subject.where(resolve() is Patient)` is inherited from the FHIR base.  Nevertheless, the maximum cardinality of `subject` is 1 for all of these cases so there will never be more than han one item in the collection when resolving the reference. Additionally, this invariant has been tested in the FHIRPath tester and is intended as written. ===


# === This Search Parameter expression `Goal.target.due as date` is inherited from the FHIR base.  This is a legitimate warning and in R5 the expression has been udpated to `(Goal.target.due.ofType(date))`.  Since US Core inherits from the FHIR R4 base this warning is acknowledged as an issue with the base specification. ===

WARNING: SearchParameter/us-core-goal-target-date: SearchParameter.expression: The left side is inherently a collection, and so the expression 'Goal.target.due as date' may fail or return false if there is more than one item in the content being evaluated

# ===  The following Warning is understood and the invariant reviewed. The resolve() specified in the invariant has a maximum cardinality of 1 so there will never be more than han one item in the collection when resolving the reference. This invariant has been tested in the FHIRPath tester and is intended as written ===


# === The US Core Observation Profile are based on US Vendor and Community input and decided that the `Observation.performer` element is optional for Many Observation profiles. ===

Best Practice Recommendation: In general, all observations should have a performer

# === The 'no-narrative' parameter is used for these resources instances because they are displayed as inline json examples for transaction and the narrative degrades human readability ===

# === In this example, representing the concept clearly with a human readable annotations {pack-years} is not misleading. It clearly illustrates how to use the Observation with the code and is a clinical need that outweighs the concerns about using the annotation. new in ver 7.0.0 ===

WARNING: Observation/pack-years-example: Observation.value.ofType(Quantity): UCUM Codes that contain human readable annotations like {pack-years} can be misleading (e.g. they are ignored when comparing units). Best Practice is not to depend on annotations in the UCUM code, so this usage should be checked
