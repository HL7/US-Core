ERROR: ValueSet.where(id = 'simple-language'): Error from server: Language valuesets cannot be expanded as they are based on a grammar


# === Added this STU NOTE: This profile is technically non-conformant with the base FHIR ver 4.0.1 vitals profile which defines a required binding that excludes the concept for L/min for Observation.component.value(x). This is a known issue in and it means validation errors may occur when validating against this version of the US Core Pulse Oximetry Profile. A change request to correct this has been applied to the base FHIR ver 4.3.0 (“Release 4B”)===

ERROR: US Core Vital Signs Profile.Observation.component.value[x]: illegal attempt to change the binding on Observation.component.value[x] from required to extensible

# === The following comment is understood and acknowledged.  In some cases it inherits binding from core and A change request to correct this has been applied to the base FHIR ver 4.3.0 (“Release 4B”) to clarify the binding applies to the Quantity data type. Will need to slice value[x] in future ===

The element Observation.value[x] has a binding, and has multiple types subject to bindings ([dateTime, boolean, string, SampledData, Quantity, Period, Ratio, integer, time, Range, CodeableConcept]). The binding will apply to all the types
INFORMATION: StructureDefinition/us-core-vital-signs: StructureDefinition.differential.element[14].binding: The element Observation.component.value[x] has a binding, and has multiple types subject to bindings ([dateTime, boolean, string, SampledData, Quantity, Period, Ratio, integer, time, Range, CodeableConcept]). The binding will apply to all the types


# ==== The following content is inherited from the base standard and cannot be changed ====

The markdown contains content that appears to be an embedded HTML tag starting at 'Th'. This will (or SHOULD) be escaped by the presentation layer. The content should be checked to confirm that this is the desired behaviour
The string value contains text that looks like embedded HTML tags. If this content is rendered to HTML without appropriate post-processing, it may be a security risk

# ==== The pattern is defined in the slice and not in the repeating element ($this) which allows users the necessary flexibility ====

INFORMATION: StructureDefinition/us-core-organization: StructureDefinition.snapshot.element[18].pattern.ofType(Identifier): The repeating element has a pattern. The pattern will apply to all the repeats (this has not been clear to all users)

# === The following Warning is understood and the extension reviewed - its intent is to be used on elements that are jurisdictional requirement which could be potentially any element ===

WARNING: StructureDefinition/us-core-jurisdiction: StructureDefinition.context[0]: Review the extension type: extensions should not have a context of Element unless it's really intended that they can be used anywhere

# === Using the extension US Core Extension Questionnaire URI  pointing to a pdf form of the Questionnaire for this example ===

No questionnaire is identified, so no validation can be performed against the base questionnaire
