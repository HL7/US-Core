# ===  4 ERRORS Discussed on FMG IG review and variance granted 7.0.0  ===
# ===========================================================-=====================

# === Added this STU NOTE: This profile is technically non-conformant with the base FHIR ver 4.0.1 vitals profile, which defines a required binding that excludes the concept for L/min for Observation.component.value(x). This is a known issue, which means validation errors may occur when validating against this version of the US Core Pulse Oximetry Profile. This issue has been corrected in base FHIR ver 4.3.0 ("Release 4B") which will correct this error when this guide is based a newer version of FHIR. ===

ERROR: Observation/satO2-fiO2: Observation.component[0].value.ofType(Quantity): The code provided (http://unitsofmeasure.org#L/min) was not found in the value set' Vital Signs Units' (http://hl7.org/fhir/ValueSet/ucum-vitals-common|4.0.1), and a code from this value set is required: The provided code 'http://unitsofmeasure.org#L/min' was not found in the value set 'http://hl7.org/fhir/ValueSet/ucum-vitals-common|4.0.1'
ERROR: US Core Vital Signs Profile.Observation.component.value[x]: illegal attempt to change the binding on Observation.component.value[x] from required to extensible

This element does not match any known slice defined in the profile http://hl7.org/fhir/uv/sdc/StructureDefinition/sdc-questionnaire|3.0.0

# === The code is from the US Core defined NUCC binding and not from base FHIR preferred c80-practice-codes value set (updated text from 7.0.0) ===

None of the codings provided are in the value set 'Practice Setting Code Value Set' (http://hl7.org/fhir/ValueSet/c80-practice-codes|4.0.1), and a coding is recommended to come from this value set (codes = http://nucc.org/provider-taxonomy#208D00000X)

The string value contains text that looks like embedded HTML tags. If this content is rendered to HTML without appropriate post-processing, it may be a security risk

# ===  The following Warning is understood and the invariant reviewed. The type specified in ofType is CodeableConcept *is* a possible candidate for the existing value[x] types. This invariant has been tested in the FHIRPath tester and is intended as written ===


# === This Search Parameter expression `[Type].subject.where(resolve() is Patient)` is inherited from the FHIR base. Nevertheless, the maximum cardinality of `subject` is 1 for all of these cases, so there will never be more than one item in the collection when resolving the reference. Additionally, this invariant has been tested in the FHIRPath tester and is intended as written. ===


# === This Search Parameter expression `Goal.target.due as date` is inherited from the FHIR base. Since US Core inherits from the FHIR R4 base, this warning is acknowledged as an issue with the base specification. In R5, this expression has been updated to `(Goal.target.due.ofType(date))`. ===

WARNING: SearchParameter/us-core-goal-target-date: SearchParameter.expression: The left side is inherently a collection, and so the expression 'Goal.target.due as date' may fail or return false if there is more than one item in the content being evaluated

# ===  This invariant has been tested in the FHIRPath tester and is intended as written. The resolve() specified in the invariant has a maximum cardinality of 1, so there will never be more than one item in the collection when resolving the reference.  ===


# === The US Core Observation Profile is based on US Vendor and Community input, and it was decided that the `Observation.performer` element is optional for Many Observation profiles. ===


# === The 'no-narrative' parameter is used for these resources instances because they are displayed as inline JSON examples to illustrate transactions and the narrative degrades human readability ===

# ==== The US Core Team is aware of this and will budget and move these values to THO in a future publication cycle ===

Most code systems defined in HL7 IGs will need to move to THO later during the process. Consider giving this code system a THO URL now (See https://confluence.hl7.org/display/TSMG/Terminology+Play+Book, and/or talk to TSMG)

# === In this example, representing the concept clearly with human-readable annotations {pack-years} is not misleading. It clearly illustrates how to use the Observation with the code, and demonstrates a clinical need outweighing concerns about using annotations. new in ver 7.0.0 ===

WARNING: Observation/pack-years-example: Observation.value.ofType(Quantity): UCUM Codes that contain human readable annotations like {pack-years} can be misleading (e.g. they are ignored when comparing units). Best Practice is not to depend on annotations in the UCUM code, so this usage should be checked


# === These errors are awaiting updates to the VSAC to resolve new in ver 8.0.0 ===




# === US Core thoroughly documents its Must Support expectations for the must supports, including how they apply to choice of target references. See this chat https://chat.fhir.org/#narrow/channel/179252-IG-creation/topic/Must.20Support.20Target.20Error.20for.20Reference.20type.20Element ===

# === The binding applies to the Quantity data type for US Core Vitals Signs Profile. It inherits the structure from Core, and a change request to correct this has been applied to the base FHIR ver 4.3.0 ("Release 4B"). Will need to slice value[x] in future (updated text from 7.0.0)  ===

The element Observation.value[x] has a binding, and has multiple types subject to bindings ([dateTime, boolean, string, SampledData, Quantity, Period, Ratio, integer, time, Range, CodeableConcept]). The binding will apply to all the types

The element Observation.component.value[x] has a binding, and has multiple types subject to bindings ([dateTime, boolean, string, SampledData, Quantity, Period, Ratio, integer, time, Range, CodeableConcept]). The binding will apply to all the types
