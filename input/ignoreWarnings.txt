# ===  4 ERRORS Discussed on FMG IG review and variance granted 8.0.0  ===
# ===========================================================-=====================

# 01. === Added this STU NOTE: This profile is technically non-conformant with the base FHIR ver 4.0.1 vitals profile, which defines a required binding that excludes the concept for L/min for Observation.component.value(x). This is a known issue, which means validation errors may occur when validating against this version of the US Core Pulse Oximetry Profile. This issue has been corrected in base FHIR ver 4.3.0 ("Release 4B"), which will correct this error when this guide is based on a newer version of FHIR. ===

ERROR: Observation/satO2-fiO2: Observation.component[0].value.ofType(Quantity): The code provided (http://unitsofmeasure.org#L/min) was not found in the value set' Vital Signs Units' (http://hl7.org/fhir/ValueSet/ucum-vitals-common|4.0.1), and a code from this value set is required: The provided code 'http://unitsofmeasure.org#L/min' was not found in the value set 'http://hl7.org/fhir/ValueSet/ucum-vitals-common|4.0.1'
ERROR: US Core Vital Signs Profile.Observation.component.value[x]: illegal attempt to change the binding on Observation.component.value[x] from required to extensible

# 02. ==== Since the ValueSet's grammar-based definition leads to an infinite set, it cannot be expanded and leads to the following error ===

# 03. === Based upon FHIR-I's guidance on backporting CodeableReference dataype in R4 implementations, using the FHIR R5-based Sex Parameters for Clinical Use Extension is correct. The publication valiidation tool needs to updated to validate it correctly.  See this Chat: https://chat.fhir.org/#narrow/channel/179166-implementers/topic/UV.20Extension.20Sex.20Parameter.20for.20clinical.20use.20broken.20for.20R4.3F ===

# 04. === Because CPT does not recognize the "is-a" filter, the publication validator does not recognize it. See this Chat: https://chat.fhir.org/#narrow/channel/179252-IG-creation/topic/Clarify.20why.20terminology.20server.20is.20yielding.20this.20error  The publication and VSAC team is clarifying with CPT whether this filter is allowed.

# === Warnings and Hints to be Discussed on FMG IG review  (granted for 8.0.0 ballot)====
# =========================================================================================

# 01. ===  The tooling infrastructure cannot access these codes because this value set is more recent than the latest VSAC package. They have been checked, and the concepts are correct===

# ValueSet http://cts.nlm.nih.gov/fhir/ValueSet/2.16.840.1.113762.1.4.1099.54 not found by validator

# 02. === US Core Goal Description Binding is extensible, which allows for text only, and guidance on using free text for `Goal.description` is provided.  ===


# 03. === Circular US Core Warnings since this is US Core (4): NONE ===


# 04. === Several examples derived from this profile are provided in this guide (1) ===

WARNING: StructureDefinition.where(URL = 'http://hl7.org/fhir/us/core/StructureDefinition/us-core-vital-signs'): The Implementation Guide contains no examples for this profile

# 05. === These questionnaires are created using NLM tooling based on LOINC LFORMs. They use standard FHIR Questionnaire Extensions that "extend" the base SDC profile ===

This element does not match any known slice defined in the profile http://hl7.org/fhir/uv/sdc/StructureDefinition/sdc-questionnaire|3.0.0

# 06. === The code is from the US Core defined NUCC binding and not from base FHIR preferred c80-practice-codes value set (updated text from 7.0.0) ===

None of the codings provided are in the value set 'Practice Setting Code Value Set' (http://hl7.org/fhir/ValueSet/c80-practice-codes|4.0.1), and a coding is recommended to come from this value set (codes = http://nucc.org/provider-taxonomy#208D00000X)

# 08. ==== The following content is inherited from the base standard and cannot be changed ====

The string value contains text that looks like embedded HTML tags. If this content is rendered to HTML without appropriate post-processing, it may be a security risk

# 09. ==== The pattern is set in a repeating slice. The pattern is expected to hold for all repetitions of that slice. (It's fixing the 'system' for the identifier.) ====

The repeating element has a pattern. The pattern will apply to all the repeats (this has not been clear to all users)

# 10. ==== The self-link for these searchset bundles is to the $docref operation and not to a FHIR search string====

No types could be determined from the search string, so the types can't be checked

# 13. ===  The following Warning is understood, and the invariant was reviewed. The type specified in ofType is CodeableConcept *is* a possible candidate for the existing value[x] types. This invariant has been tested in the FHIRPath tester and is intended as written ===


# 14. === This Search Parameter expression `[Type].subject.where(resolve() is Patient)` is inherited from the FHIR base. Nevertheless, the maximum cardinality of `subject` is 1 for all of these cases, so there will never be more than one item in the collection when resolving the reference. Additionally, this invariant has been tested in the FHIRPath tester and is intended as written. ===


# 15. === This Search Parameter expression `Goal.target.due as date` is inherited from the FHIR base. Since US Core inherits from the FHIR R4 base, this warning is acknowledged as an issue with the base specification. In R5, this expression has been updated to `(Goal.target.due.ofType(date))`. ===

WARNING: SearchParameter/us-core-goal-target-date: SearchParameter.expression: The left side is inherently a collection, and so the expression 'Goal.target.due as date' may fail or return false if there is more than one item in the content being evaluated

# 16. ===  This invariant has been tested in the FHIRPath tester and is intended as written. The resolve() specified in the invariant has a maximum cardinality of 1, so there will never be more than one item in the collection when resolving the reference.  ===

There are multiple different potential matches for the url 'http://terminology.hl7.org/ValueSet/v3-PurposeOfUse'. It might be a good idea to fix to the correct version to reduce the likelihood of a wrong version being selected by an implementation/implementer, or use the [IG Parameter `pin-canonicals`](https://hl7.org/fhir/tools/CodeSystem-ig-parameters.html).

# 28. === In this example, representing the concept clearly with human-readable annotations {pack-years} is not misleading. It clearly illustrates how to use the Observation with the code and demonstrates a clinical need outweighing concerns about using annotations. ===

WARNING: Observation/pack-years-example: Observation.value.ofType(Quantity): UCUM Codes that contain human readable annotations like {pack-years} can be misleading (e.g. they are ignored when comparing units). Best Practice is not to depend on annotations in the UCUM code, so this usage should be checked

# 34. === US Core provides IG-specific guidance on interpreting Must Support for slices at `~/must-support.html#must-support---slices`. Where we state: "...the slicer's Must Support property only defines the element level Must Support/Additional USCDI property. In other words, the slicer's Must Support/Additional USCDI is not inherited by the slices, and each slice must be explicitly tagged with the Must Support/Additional USCDI property to define that slice's conformance strength. If no Must Support/Additional USCDI property is defined for the slice, this lengthy chat: https://chat.fhir.org/#narrow/channel/179252-IG-creation/topic/Slices.20not.20inheriting.20preferred.20bindings.20from.20root/with/514257770 and the resulting tracker FHIR-50391. ===

The extension http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/elementdefinition-maxValueSet|5.2.0 is deprecated
The extension http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/elementdefinition-minValueSet|5.2.0 is deprecated
The extension http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/regex|5.2.0 is deprecated with the note This was deprecated in favor of using a constraint on the element using FHIRPath, since constraints allow for the provision of a human readable message associated with the regex
The extension http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/ordinalValue|5.2.0 is deprecated with the note Replaced by [[[http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/itemWeight]]]
