# ========================================================================================

# 01. ===  The tooling infrastructure cannot access these codes because this value set is more recent than the latest VSAC package. They have been checked, and the concepts are correct===

# ValueSet http://cts.nlm.nih.gov/fhir/ValueSet/2.16.840.1.113762.1.4.1099.54 not found by validator
# The valueSet reference http://cts.nlm.nih.gov/fhir/ValueSet/2.16.840.1.113762.1.4.1099.54 on element Specimen.type could not be resolved


# 02. === US Core Goal Description Binding is extensible, which allows for text only, and guidance on using free text for `Goal.description` is provided.  ===


# 03. === Circular US Core Warnings since this is US Core (4): NONE ===


# 04. === Several examples derived from this profile are provided in this guide (1) ===

WARNING: StructureDefinition.where(URL = 'http://hl7.org/fhir/us/core/StructureDefinition/us-core-vital-signs'): The Implementation Guide contains no examples for this profile

# 05. === These questionnaires are created using NLM tooling based on LOINC LFORMs. They use standard FHIR Questionnaire Extensions that "extend" the base SDC profile ===

This element does not match any known slice defined in the profile http://hl7.org/fhir/uv/sdc/StructureDefinition/sdc-questionnaire|3.0.0

# 06. === The code is from the US Core defined NUCC binding and not from base FHIR preferred c80-practice-codes value set (updated text from 7.0.0) ===

None of the codings provided are in the value set 'Practice Setting Code Value Set' (http://hl7.org/fhir/ValueSet/c80-practice-codes|4.0.1), and a coding is recommended to come from this value set (codes = http://nucc.org/provider-taxonomy#208D00000X)


# 07. === Examples provided in Bundle (e.g. PractitionerRole_Practitioner_Endpoint_Bundle_Example, Allergyintolerance Provenance Example) (2)===


INFORMATION: StructureDefinition.where(url = 'http://hl7.org/fhir/us/core/StructureDefinition/us-core-practitionerrole'): The Implementation Guide contains no explicitly linked examples for this profile


# 08. === The following content is inherited from the base standard and cannot be changed ===

The string value contains text that looks like embedded HTML tags. If this content is rendered to HTML without appropriate post-processing, it may be a security risk

# 09. === The pattern is set in a repeating slice. The pattern is expected to hold for all repetitions of that slice. (It's fixing the 'system' for the identifier.) ===

The repeating element has a pattern. The pattern will apply to all the repeats (this has not been clear to all users)

# 10. === The self-link for these searchset bundles is to the $docref operation and not to a FHIR search string====

No types could be determined from the search string, so the types can't be checked

# 11. === Using the extension US Core Extension Questionnaire URI  pointing to a pdf form of the Questionnaire for this example. Regarding the message: "No questionnaire is identified, so no validation can be performed against the base questionnaire" ===

INFORMATION: QuestionnaireResponse/glascow-coma-score: QuestionnaireResponse: No questionnaire is identified, so no validation can be performed against the base questionnaire

# 12. ===  The following Warning is understood, and the invariant has been reviewed. The type specified in ofType is Quantity *is* a possible candidate for the existing types of value[x]. This invariant has been tested in the FHIRPath tester and is intended as written ===


# 13. ===  The following Warning is understood, and the invariant was reviewed. The type specified in ofType is CodeableConcept *is* a possible candidate for the existing value[x] types. This invariant has been tested in the FHIRPath tester and is intended as written ===


# 14. === This Search Parameter expression `[Type].subject.where(resolve() is Patient)` is inherited from the FHIR base. Nevertheless, the maximum cardinality of `subject` is 1 for all of these cases, so there will never be more than one item in the collection when resolving the reference. Additionally, this invariant has been tested in the FHIRPath tester and is intended as written. ===


# 15. === This Search Parameter expression `Goal.target.due as date` is inherited from the FHIR base. Since US Core inherits from the FHIR R4 base, this warning is acknowledged as an issue with the base specification. In R5, this expression has been updated to `(Goal.target.due.ofType(date))`. ===

WARNING: SearchParameter/us-core-goal-target-date: SearchParameter.expression: The left side is inherently a collection, and so the expression 'Goal.target.due as date' may fail or return false if there is more than one item in the content being evaluated

# 16. ===  This invariant has been tested in the FHIRPath tester and is intended as written. The resolve() specified in the invariant has a maximum cardinality of 1, so there will never be more than one item in the collection when resolving the reference.  ===


# 17. === The 'no-narrative' parameter is used for these resources instances because they are displayed as inline JSON examples to illustrate transactions, and the narrative degrades human readability ===

# 28. === In this example, representing the concept clearly with human-readable annotations {pack-years} is not misleading. It clearly illustrates how to use the Observation with the code and demonstrates a clinical need outweighing concerns about using annotations. ===

WARNING: Observation/pack-years-example: Observation.value.ofType(Quantity): UCUM Codes that contain human readable annotations like {pack-years} can be misleading (e.g. they are ignored when comparing units). Best Practice is not to depend on annotations in the UCUM code, so this usage should be checked

# 29. === US Core thoroughly documents its Must Support expectations for the must supports on the Must Support page, including how they apply to the choice of target references in the Must Support - Resource References section. (Also,  see this chat https://chat.fhir.org/#narrow/channel/179252-IG-creation/topic/Must.20Support.20Target.20Error.20for.20Reference.20type.20Element ===

The element Procedure.performer.actor has types/profiles/targets that are marked as must support, but the element itself is not marked as must-support

# 30. === Two Bundle examples use this profile and one non-validated inline example that conforms to it as well - when the publisher understands versioned examples, we will create a published example to replace it.  ===

# 31. === The binding applies to the Quantity data type for US Core Vitals Signs Profile. It inherits the structure from Core, and a change request to correct this has been applied to the base FHIR ver 4.3.0 ("Release 4B"). Will need to slice value[x] in future (updated text from 7.0.0)  ===

The element Observation.value[x] has a binding, and has multiple types subject to bindings ([dateTime, boolean, string, SampledData, Quantity, Period, Ratio, integer, time, Range, CodeableConcept]). The binding will apply to all the types

The element Observation.component.value[x] has a binding, and has multiple types subject to bindings ([dateTime, boolean, string, SampledData, Quantity, Period, Ratio, integer, time, Range, CodeableConcept]). The binding will apply to all the types

# 32. === A US Direct Address for secure messaging in healthcare typically follows a format similar to an email address. for example `john.doe@direct.myhealthcareprovider.org`. Although this URL will not resolve, it represents a legitimate example of the direct address in the `endpoint.address` field. ===

# 33. === To comply with Executive Order 14168, the following changes were made: 1)Removed USCDI mapping, guidance, and examples for the US Core Observation Sexual Orientation Profile  2) Removed the US Core Birth Sex Extension, guidance, and examples from the US Core Patient Profile 3) Deprecated the US Core Gender Identity and US Core Sex Extensions and removed them from the US Core Profile, USCDI mapping, guidance, and examples. Although the profiles and extensions will remain in this version of US Core to allow for backward compatibility - no examples will be supplied. ===

# 34. === US Core provides IG-specific guidance on interpreting Must Support for slices at `~/must-support.html#must-support---slices`. Where we state: "...the slicer's Must Support property only defines the element level Must Support/Additional USCDI property. In other words, the slicer's Must Support/Additional USCDI is not inherited by the slices, and each slice must be explicitly tagged with the Must Support/Additional USCDI property to define that slice's conformance strength. If no Must Support/Additional USCDI property is defined for the slice, this lengthy chat: https://chat.fhir.org/#narrow/channel/179252-IG-creation/topic/Slices.20not.20inheriting.20preferred.20bindings.20from.20root/with/514257770 and the resulting tracker FHIR-50391. ===

# 49 === This guide uses a custom liquid script to generat the the CapabilityStatement narrative. To facilate rendering of displays and relative links to human readable content, the Capability statemnent uses the Display Name and Narrative Link extensions on the canonicals types - 'supportedProfiles', 'operation.definition', and 'implementationGuide' elements.  As a result, the relative links in the Narrative Link extensions will generate "No definition could be found" warnings wherever they are used. For example: "No definition could be found for URL value 'StructureDefinition-us-core-allergyintolerance.html'" The warning have been checked and are valid links internal to to guide or to other guides.
