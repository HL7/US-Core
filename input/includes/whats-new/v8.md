- To promote the visibility of the future direction of US Core, we created a new [Looking Ahead](looking-ahead.html) menu tab with the menu items:
  - [US Core Roadmap](us-core-roadmap.html): Existing content moved from the renamed Future of US Core page
   - [Writing Vital Signs](writing-vital-signs.html): Existing content moved from the renamed Future of US Core page
   - [Patient Data Feed](patient-data-feed.html): New optional feature for servers implementing US Core. It allows clients to receive FHIR Subscription Notifications when events occur related to US Core content.
- We continue our efforts to link terminology directly to the FHIRÂ® Terminology Service for VSAC Resources (Value Set Authority Center (VSAC)) where applicable and, as a result, align terminology between US Core and [HL7 C-CDA]. In this version, the following value sets have been added or moved to VSAC:

   |Pre 7.0.0  US Core ValueSet|7.0.0 VSAC ValueSet|
   |---|---|
