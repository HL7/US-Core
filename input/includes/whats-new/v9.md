1. To provide a clear, consolidated reference for implementers working with this guide, we have added a new [Requirements Table](requirements.html) page and [Requirements Resources](capability-statements.html).  ​They lists the requirements defined in the US Core Implementation Guide’s narrative sections. These requirements represent the regulatory, business, functional, and technical specifications that design artifacts must meet to ensure interoperability.
2. Following ballot feedback reconciliation and input from ASTP, we will not add the US Core PMO ServiceRequest Profile to US Core.  However, we will add guidance to the ADI DocumentReference Profile on how clinical orders can be derived from a Portable Medical Order (PMO).
3. As indicated in the ballot, we added links to annually updates to Value Set Packages that contain expanded value sets required for US Core version 6.1.0, 8.0.1, and 9.0.0.
4. We discovered that our use of the FHIR R5 profile data structure, "additionalBinding", for coded elements did not communicate our intent. Therefore, we have reverted or updated these element definitions to accurately reflect our intent.  We will revisit using "additionalBinding" when it it more mature and its meaning are clearly understood by profilers and implementers.
