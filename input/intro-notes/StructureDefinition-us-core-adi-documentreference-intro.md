**Example Usage Scenarios:**

The following are example usage scenarios for the US Core ADI DocumentReference profile. See the [Clinical Notes] section for additional details on using this profile for Clinical Notes:

-   Query for all ADI documents belonging to a Patient
-   Query for a specific ADI Document type (e.g., POLST or Living Will)
-   Write a new ADI document to a Patient's Chart

### Mandatory and Must Support Data Elements

The following data elements must always be present ([Mandatory] definition) or must be supported if the data is present in the sending system ([Must Support] definition). They are presented below in a simple human-readable explanation. Profile specific guidance and examples are provided as well. The [Formal Views] below provides the formal summary, definitions, and terminology requirements.

**Each DocumentReference Must Have:**

1. a status
2. a code describing the type of ADI document (for example, Advanced Directive for intubation)
3. an ADI document category (for example, Advanced Directives)
4. a patient
5. document referenced (content)
6. the MIME type (i.e., contentType) of the document

**Each DocumentReference Must Support:**

1. a business identifier for the DocumentReference (possibly generated by the transcription system or EHR)
1. date and time the DocumentReference was created
1. an author
2. a verifier (in other words, an authenticator)
3. a verification date
4. a code identifying the specific details about the format of the document â€” over and above the content's MIME type
5. the patient encounter that is being referenced
6. clinically relevant date

**Profile Specific Implementation Guidance:**

- In addition to the [Advance Healthcare Directive Categories Grouper](http://cts.nlm.nih.gov/fhir/ValueSet/2.16.840.1.113762.1.4.1115.25) value set, other category schemes may be used to facilitate the sharing of health documents.
- The DocumentReference resources can represent the referenced content using either an address where the document can be retrieved using `DocumentReference.attachment.url` or the content as inline base64 encoded data using `DocumentReference.attachment.data`.
    -  Although both are marked as Must Support, the server system is not required to support an address and inline base64 encoded data, but **SHALL** support at least one of these elements.
    -  The client application **SHALL** support both elements.
    -  The `content.url` may refer to a FHIR Binary Resource (i.e., [base]/Binary/[id]), FHIR Document Bundle (i.e., [base]/Bundle/[id], or another endpoint.
        - If the endpoint is outside the FHIR base URL, it **SHOULD NOT** require additional authorization to access.
    -  If there are multiple `DocumentReference.content` element repetitions, these **SHALL** all represent the same document in different formats or attachment metadata. The content element **SHALL NOT** contain different versions of the same content. For version handling, use multiple DocumentReferences with `DocumentReference.relatesTo`. 
- Every DocumentReference must have a responsible Organization. The organization responsible for the DocumentReference **SHALL** be present either in `DocumentReference.custodian` or accessible in the Provenance resource targeting the DocumentReference using `Provenance.agent.who` or `Provenance.agent.onBehalfOf`.
   - Some systems may also expose the same organization in referenced Encounter in `Encounter.serviceProvider`.
