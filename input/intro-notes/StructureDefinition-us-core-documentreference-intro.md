**Example Usage Scenarios:**

The following are example usage scenarios for the US Core DocumentReference profile.  See the [Clinical Notes] section for additional detail on using this profile for Clinical Notes:

-   Query for all documents belonging to a Patient
-   Query for a specific Clinical Note type (e.g. Discharge Summary or Continuity of Care Document (CCD))
-   Query for all Clinical Notes belonging to a Patient
-   Write a new Note to a Patient's Chart

### Mandatory and Must Support Data Elements

The following data-elements must always be present ([Mandatory] definition) or must be supported if the data is present in the sending system ([Must Support] definition). They are presented below in a simple human-readable explanation.  Profile specific guidance and examples are provided as well.  The [Formal Profile Definition] below provides the  formal summary, definitions, and  terminology requirements.

**Each DocumentReference must have:**

1.  a status
1.  a code describing the type of document
1.  a document category
1.  a patient
1.  document referenced (content)
1.  the MIME type (i.e. contentType) of the document

**Each DocumentReference must support:**

1.  a business identifier for the DocumentReference (possibly generated by the transcription system or EHR)
1.  date and time the reference was created
1.  an author
1.  a code identifying the specific details about the format of the document — over and above the content's MIME type
1.  the patient encounter that is being referenced
1. clinically relevant date

**Profile specific implementation guidance:**

- See [Clinical Notes]
- The `DocumentReference.type` binding must support at a minimum the [5 Common Clinical Notes] and may extend to the full  [US Core DocumentReference Type Value Set]
- For a C-CDA Clinical Summary of Care (CCD):
   -  The document type code is the LOINC code [34133-9] *Summary of episode note*.
   -  The format code is `urn:hl7-org:sdwg:ccda-structuredBody:2.1`
- The DocumentReference resources can represent the referenced content using either an address where the document can be retrieved using `DocumentReference.attachment.url` or the content as inline base64 encoded data using `DocumentReference.attachment.data`.
    -  Although both are marked as must support, the server system is not required to support both an address and inline base64 encoded data, but **SHALL** support at least one of these elements.
    -  The client application SHALL support both elements.
    -  The `content.url` may refer to a FHIR Binary Resource (i.e. [base]/Binary/[id]), FHIR Document Bundle (i.e [base]/Bundle/[id] or other endpoint.
        - If the endpoint is outside of the FHIR base URL, it **SHOULD NOT** require additional authorization to access.
- The organization responsible for the DocumentReference **SHALL** be present either in `DocumentReference.custodian` or accessible in the Provenance resource targeting the DocumentReference using `Provenance.agent.who` or `Provenance.agent.onBehalfOf`.
   - Some system may also expose the same organization in referenced Encounter in 'Encounter.serviceProvider'.
