This profile sets minimum expectations for searching and fetching fetching patient documents including Clinical Notes using the [DocumentReference] resource. It identifies the mandatory core elements, extensions, vocabularies and value sets which **SHALL** be present in the DocumentReference resource when using this profile. Prior to reviewing this profile, implementers are encouraged to read the [Clinical Notes Guidance] to understand the overlap of [US Core DocumentReference Profile] and [US Core DiagnosticReport Profile for Report and Note exchange].

**Example Usage Scenarios:**

The following are example usage scenarios for the US Core DocumentReference profile.  See the [Clinical Notes Guidance] section for additional detail on using this profile for Clinical Notes:

-   Query for all documents belonging to a Patient
-   Query for a specific Clinical Note type (e.g. Discharge Summary or Continuity of Care Document (CCD))
-   Query for all Clinical Notes belonging to a Patient
-   Write a new Note to a Patient's Chart

### Mandatory and Must Support Data Elements

The following data-elements are mandatory (i.e data MUST be present) or must be supported if the data is present in the sending system ([Must Support] definition). They are presented below in a simple human-readable explanation.  Profile specific guidance and examples are provided as well.  The [Formal Profile Definition] below provides the  formal summary, definitions, and  terminology requirements.

**Each DocumentReference must have:**

1.  a status
1.  a document category
1.  a code describing the type of document
1.  a patient
1.  the MIME type (i.e. contentType) of the document
1.  an address (e.g. url) where the document can be retrieved or the content as inline base64 encoded data

**Each DocumentReference must support:**

1.  a business identifier for the DocumentReference (possibly generated by the transcription system or EHR)
1.  date and time the reference was created
1.  an author
1.  the organization responsible for the document, referred to as custodian.
1.  a code identifying the specific details about the format of the document — over and above the content's MIME type
1.  the patient encounter that is being referenced
1. clinically relevant date


**Profile specific implementation guidance:**

- See [Clinical Notes Guidance]
- The `DocumentReference.type` binding must support at a minimum the [5 Common Clinical Notes] and may extend to the full  [US Core DocumentReference Type Value Set]
- For a C-CDA Clinical Summary of Care (CCD):
   -  The document type code is the LOINC code [34133-9] *Summary of episode note*.
   -  The format code is `urn:hl7-org:sdwg:ccda-structuredBody:2.1`
-   The `content.url` may refer to a FHIR Binary Resource (i.e. [base]/Binary/[id]), FHIR Document Bundle (i.e [base]/Bundle/[id] or other endpoint.
    - {:.new-content #FHIR-28472}If the endpoint is outside of the FHIR base URL, it **SHOULD NOT** require additional authorization to access.

#### Examples

-  [DocumentReference-episode-summary] Retrieve a URL for an episode summary note (CCD).
