-   Query for recent patient encounters
-   [Record or update] an encounter

### Mandatory and Must Support Data Elements


The following data elements must always be present ([Mandatory] definition) or must be supported if the data is present in the sending system ([Must Support] definition). They are presented below in a simple human-readable explanation. Profile specific guidance and examples are provided as well. The [Formal Views] below provides the formal summary, definitions, and terminology requirements.  

**Each Encounter Must Have:**

1. A status
1. A classification such as inpatient, outpatient, or emergency
1. An encounter type
1. A patient

**Each Encounter Must Support:**

1. A timestamp when the resource last changed*
1. An encounter identifier
1. Providers involved in the encounter
1. When the encounter occurred
1. Reason for the visit
1. The discharge disposition
1. Where the encounter occurred

1. Interpreter Needed flag*

*see guidance below

**Profile Specific Implementation Guidance:**

* To search for an encounter diagnosis, query for Condition resources that reference the Encounter of interest and have a category of `encounter-diagnosis`.   An example search is shown in the [Condition Quick Start] section.
* The Encounter resource can represent a reason using a code with `Encounter.reasonCode` or a reference with `Encounter.reasonReference` to  Condition or other resources.
   * Although both are marked as Must Support, Servers are not required to support both a code and a reference, but they **SHALL** support *at least one* of these elements.
   * The Client application **SHALL** support both elements.
   * If `Encounter.reasonReference` references an Observation, it **SHOULD** conform to a US Core Observation if applicable. For example, a laboratory result **SHOULD** conform to the [US Core Laboratory Result Observation Profile].
* This profile supports *where the encounter occurred*.  The location address can be represented by the Location referenced by `Encounter.location.location` or indirectly through the Organization referenced by `Encounter.serviceProvider`.
  * Although both are marked as Must Support, Servers are not required to support both `Encounter.location.location` and `Encounter.serviceProvider`, but they **SHALL** support *at least one* of these elements.
  * The Client application **SHALL** support both elements.

- \*Servers can use the US Core Interpreter Needed Extension on this profile or the [US Core Patient Profile] to communicate whether a patient needs an interpreter. Although the extension is marked as an *Additional USCDI Requirements* on both US Core Patient and US Core Encounter Profiles, the certifying Server system is not required to support the extension on both profiles, but **SHALL** support the extension on at least one. The certifying Client application **SHALL** support the extension on both profiles.
  - Systems **SHOULD** designate the patient's preferred language in the `Patient.communication.preferred` element.

- \* See the US Core General Guidance page for [Searching Using lastUpdated]. Updates to `.meta.lastUpdated` **SHOULD** reflect:
  - New encounters/visits
  - Changes in the status of encounters, including events that trigger the same status (e.g., in-progress â†’ in-progress). These status changes correspond to events that can initiate [HL7 V2] ADT messages.
