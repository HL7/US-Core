### Profile specific implementation guidance

- This extension provides concepts to describe the gender a person identifies as. It is not used to describe a person's sexual orientation (who they are attracted to).
- The concepts included here are from the [HL7 Gender Harmony Project], which is modeling gender and sex information data elements, value sets, and code systems.

- A<!-- [`race`]--><!--n [`ethnicity`]--> [`gender-identity`] search parameter has been defined for this extension. However, there are no  <!--race--><!--ethnicity-->gender-identity search requirements for the Client or Server.
