**Example Usage Scenarios:**

The following are example usage scenarios for the US Core-MedicationRequest
profile. See the [Medication List] section for guidance on accessing a patient medications:

-   Fetching all medications that have been prescribed to a particular patient
-   Fetching all *active* medications that have been prescribed to  particular patient
-   Fetching all medications that have been prescribed to particular patient during a particular encounter
-  [Record or update]  medications that have been prescribed for a particular
    patient

### Mandatory and Must Support Data Elements


The following data-elements must always be present ([Mandatory] definition) or must be supported if the data is present in the sending system ([Must Support] definition). They are presented below in a simple human-readable explanation.  Profile specific guidance and examples are provided as well.  The [Formal Views] below provides the  formal summary, definitions, and  terminology requirements.  

**Each MedicationRequest Must Have:**

1.  a status
1.  an intent code
1.  a medication*
1.  a patient


\* see guidance below

**Each MedicationRequest Must Support:**

1. the category  (e.g., Discharge Medication)
1. the `reported` flag  or reference signaling that information is from a secondary source such as a patient
1. the encounters
1. a prescriber
2. a date for when written
3. the prescription *Sig*
4. the amount dispensed and number of refills
5. the dose and rate


**Additional USCDI Requirements**

1. the reason or indication for the prescription*

\*see guidance below


**Profile Specific Implementation Guidance:**

* See the [Medication List] section for guidance on accessing a patient medications including over the counter (OTC) medication and other substances taken for medical and recreational use.
  * When recording “self-prescribed” medication, `requester` **SHOULD** be used to indicate the Patient or RelatedPerson as the prescriber.

{% include representing-meds.md %}

* The MedicationRequest resource can represent that information is from a secondary source using either a boolean flag or a reference using `MedicationRequest.reportedReference`.
   *  Although both are marked as Must Support, the server system is not required to support both, but **SHALL** support at least one of these elements.
   *  The client application **SHALL** support both elements.

- \*The MedicationRequest resource can communicate the reason or indication for treatment using either a code in `MedicationRequest.reasonCode` or a reference using `MedicationRequest.reasonReference`.
  - As documented [here](general-guidance.html#referencing-us-core-profiles), when using  `MedicationRequest.reasonReference`, the referenced Condition or Observation **SHOULD** be a US Core Profile.
  
* Source EHR identifiers **SHOULD** be included to support deduplication across MedicationRequest resources. Exposing the EHR identifiers helps client applications identify duplicates.
* Servers **SHALL** follow the guidance in the [Medication List] page  and return all `active` Medications as MedicationRequest. It is always best practice to confirm this list with the Patient or Caregiver.
