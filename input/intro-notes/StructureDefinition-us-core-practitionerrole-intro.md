### Mandatory and Must Support Data Elements

The following data-elements must always be present ([Mandatory] definition) or must be supported if the data is present in the sending system ([Must Support] definition). They are presented below in a simple human-readable explanation.  Profile specific guidance and examples are provided as well.  The [Formal Views] below provides the  formal summary, definitions, and  terminology requirements.

**Each PractitionerRole Must Support:**

1. An associated organization
1. An associated practitioner
1. A role
1. A specialty
1. An associated location
1. Contact information
1. A communication endpoint

**Profile Specific Implementation Guidance:**

* At least one of the following elements must be present:
    - `PractitionerRole.practitioner`
    - `PractitionerRole.organization`
    - `PractitionerRole.healthcareService`
    - `PractitionerRole.location`

* As a result of implementation feedback, the US Core Location  and PractitionerRole Profiles are not explicitly referenced in any US Core Profile. However they **SHOULD** be used as the default profile if referenced by another US Core profile. See this guidance on [Referencing US Core Profiles].
*  A [Direct address] can be represented in the `telecom` element using the [US Core Direct email Extension] or in a referenced [Endpoint] as a "direct-project" endpoint connection type.
* When selecting role codes, implementers **SHOULD** choose the code that reflects the specific duties performed within that role rather than the specialty unless the individual's professional specialization characterizes the role.
* Clients can request servers return the Practitioner resource and Endpoint resources by using `_include`. See [Quick Start].
