**Profile Specific Implementation Guidance:**

- See the [Screening and Assessments] guidance page for more information when exchanging Social Determinants of Health (SDOH) Service Requests.
- The `ServiceRequest.category` binding Must Support, at a minimum, the [US Core ServiceRequest Category Codes].  However, this valueset can be treated as [extensible], and other category codes can be used instead.
- The `ServiceRequest.code` valueset is broad to accommodate a wide variety of use cases and**SHOULD**be constrained to a subset for a particular use case or domain. (for example, LOINC for laboratory orders.)

- \*The ServiceRequest resource can communicate the reason or indication for referral or consultation using either a code in `ServiceRequest.reasonCode` or a reference using `ServiceRequest.reasonReference`.
  - As documented [here](general-guidance.html#referencing-us-core-profiles), when using  `ServiceRequest.reasonReference`, the referenced resources **SHOULD** be a US Core Profile.
