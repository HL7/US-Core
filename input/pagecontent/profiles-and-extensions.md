### Profiles

The following profiles have been defined for this implementation guide.

<!-- ================================================================
 The following Profile list is generated by the included liquid script below.
 The source data is at temp/pages/_data/structuredefinitions.json
 which is automatically generated by the build
 and the input/data/profile-metadata.csv where edits to the table contents are made
 ====================================================================== -->

{% include sd-list-generator.md %}

### Extensions

The following [Extensions] have been defined as part of the US Core Implementation Guide. A [registry of standard extensions] can be found in the FHIR specification, and additional extensions may be registered on the HL7 FHIR registry at <http://hl7.org/fhir/registry>.

<!-- ================================================================
 The following Extension lists are generated by the liquid script below.
 The source data is at temp/pages/_data/structuredefinitions.json
 which is automatically generated by the build
 and the input/data/profile-metadata.csv where manual edits to the table contents are made
 when new profile are added, deprecated, etc.

profile-metadata.csv columns:

- row: row id
- id: profile or extension's StructureDefinition id
- uri: profile or extension's canonical url
- title: profile or extension's human readable name
- rel_url: profile or extension's relative path to the narrative content page in the IG.
- is_new: Flag for new or updated content for the current version. Deafult is "FALSE" and set to "TRUE for new or updated content for the current version. It is used for QA review and published ballot versions of the guide. It set to "FALSE" before publishing new versions of the guide.
- current_fmm: FMM level in the current published version
- proposed_fmm: Proposed FMM level for next version
- added: Published version when the profile or extension was added to the guide.
- deprecated: Published version when the profile or extension was deprerated.
- retired: Published version when the profile or extension was retired.
- ig_only: Used for extensions only. Flag to indicate if the extension is used only for US Core StructureDefinitions. It is not a USCDI nor Realm specific requirement.
- realm_only:  Used for extensions only. Flag to indicate if the extension is defined for use in US Realm but is not a USCDI related requirement.
- version_notes: Notes on changes between versions. Used to inform readers in plain human readable text.
- dstu2_profile_title: Mapping of the profile or extensions to the Argonaut query DSTU2 profiles or extensions.
- ipa_compatibility: Compliance with the International Patient Access (IPA) values: "OK" = Compliant, "MAYBE" = Additional requirements needed to meet all requirements , "NO" = Incompatble ,"NA" = No equivalent profile:
- ips_compatibility: Compliance with the International Patient Summary (IPS) values: "OK" = Compliant, "MAYBE" = Additional requirements needed to meet all requirements , "NO" = Incompatble ,"NA" = No equivalent profile:
- resource_scope_conf: Resource Level SMART Scope requirements, Values: "SHALL"|"SHOULD"|"MAY"
- data_element: USCDI/HTI-1 defined scope contexts
- resource_type: profile or extension's base resource type. It is "Extension" for extensions.
- cat[n]_scope: (n =  1..6). Multiple granular scopes may be defined for a profile.
- cat[n]_scope_conf: (n =  1..6) Resource Level SMART Scope requirements, Values: "SHALL"|"SHOULD"|"MAY"  Multiple granular scopes may be defined for a profile.

The script filters out and sorts,adds relative links, and allows for highlighting new and updated content for
 deprecated, ig_only, realm_only, and profile extensions for listing in the page sections below.

#### US Core Profile Extensions
The following extensions are used in US Core Profiles.

{% assign titles = profile_titles | split: "," | sort -%}
{% for title in titles -%}
{% assign profile_meta_row = site.data.profile_metadata | where:"title", title | first -%}
- <span {% if profile_meta_row.is_new == "TRUE" %} class="bg-success"{% endif %} markdown="1">[{{ title }}]</span>
{% endfor %}

#### Other US Realm Specific Extension
The following extensions are not used in any US Core Profile. They are provided to assist implementers who may find them relevant to their specific use cases.

{% assign titles = realm_only_titles | split: "," | sort -%}
{% for title in titles -%}
{% assign profile_meta_row = site.data.profile_metadata | where:"title", title | first -%}
- <span {% if profile_meta_row.is_new == "TRUE" %} class="bg-success"{% endif %} markdown="1">[{{ title }}]</span>
{% endfor %}

#### US Core Profile StructureDefinition Extensions
The following extensions are only used in the US Core Implementation Guide to create US Core Profiles. They are used in the context of StructureDefinition elements.

{% assign titles = ig_only_titles | split: "," | sort -%}
{% for title in titles -%}
{% assign profile_meta_row = site.data.profile_metadata | where:"title", title | first -%}
- <span {% if profile_meta_row.is_new == "TRUE" %} class="bg-success"{% endif %} markdown="1">[{{ title }}]</span>
{% endfor %}

#### Deprecated US Realm Specific Extension

The following extensions are not used in any US Core Profile and are *deprecated*. They **SHOULD NOT** be used for new or revised content. They are retained for historical/backward compatibility purposes.

{% assign titles = deprecated_titles | split: "," | sort -%}
{% for title in titles -%}
{% assign profile_meta_row = site.data.profile_metadata | where:"title", title | first -%}
- <span {% if profile_meta_row.is_new == "TRUE" %} class="bg-success"{% endif %} markdown="1">[{{ title }}]</span>
{% endfor %}
