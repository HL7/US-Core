
This page lists all the ValueSets, CodeSystems, and ConceptMaps defined as part of the US Core Implementation Guide. For more information on using codes in US Core, see the [FHIR Terminology] section in the FHIR specification and the [Coded Elements] section in this guide.

### Value Sets

Most value sets used in this guide are defined in the base FHIR specification, [HL7 Terminology (THO)], or Value Set Authority Center (VSAC)]. However, US Core also defines several value sets and they are listed below.

Value sets in US Core and C-CDA may retain inactive codes. These codes may be useful for historical queries but are not recommended for new data. Implementers should note that some code systems exclude inactive codes from current expansions; if needed, these codes may be accessible through prior expansions via terminology services. HL7 recommends validators allow non-active codes with note on their status.

### Code Systems

See the [FHIR terminology section]({{site.data.fhir.path}}terminologies-systems.html) for a complete discussion on code systems and a list of code system names used in FHIR. Most code systems used in this guide are defined in the base FHIR specification. However, the following code systems are unique to this guide and not listed in the base FHIR specification. If a URI is listed here, it **SHALL** be used in the US Core profiles to identify the code system in preference to any other code system URI.

#### Code System Used in US Core

### The Value Set Authority Center (VSAC)

This guide links terminology directly to the FHIR® Terminology Service for VSAC Resources ([Value Set Authority Center (VSAC)]), where applicable, using a RESTful API service to access the VSAC value sets and supported code systems. See the table above for a list of value sets used in US Core that VSAC defines.


####   How to Acess Value Sets in VSAC


  -  VSAC requires login using your own *UMLS API Key* to view the value sets. [VSAC UMLS Licensing information](https://www.nlm.nih.gov/vsac/support/usingvsac/requestumlslicense.html). (See the screenshots below)
  - The value sets in VSAC are specified using a VSAC value set OID.  
  - To view the value set expansion in the VSAC user interface, use:

      `GET https://vsac.nlm.nih.gov/ValueSet/[VSAC OID]/expansion`

    An example of this is shown in the screenshots below.  

    When viewing a ValueSet in the VSAC UI, the Code System OIDs and VSAC Code System names are displayed for each code. However, these code system identifiers **SHOULD NOT** be used. The FHIR URIs code systems are defined as part of FHIR and **SHOULD** be used instead. Unfortunately, the FHIR URI for the code system is not shown. As a convenience for the reader, a [VSAC to FHIR Code System Mapping Table] is provided, which maps the VSAC Code System names to the corresponding FHIR URI. For more information, see this [documentation](https://www.nlm.nih.gov/vsac/support/usingvsac/vsacname-fhirname-fhirtitle.html) describing the relationships between the VSAC value set name, FHIR value set name, and FHIR value set title and how to access VSAC's FHIR API.

  - To fetch the FHIR ValueSet resource (in other words, the value set definition), use:

       `GET https://cts.nlm.nih.gov/fhir/ValueSet/[VSAC OID]`

  - To fetch the FHIR ValueSet resource expansion, use the FHIR `$expand` operation:

       `GET https://cts.nlm.nih.gov/fhir/ValueSet/[VSAC OID]/$expand`

For more information, refer to the [FHIR Terminology Service for VSAC Resources](https://www.nlm.nih.gov/vsac/support/usingvsac/vsacfhirapi.html)

##### Example

For example, the [US Core Smoking Status Observation Profile] `valueCodeableConcept` element has a preferred binding to the Smoking Status value set. To access it in VSAC, click on the link to `https://vsac.nlm.nih.gov/valueset/2.16.840.1.113883.11.20.9.38/expansion`:

 {% include img.html img="vsac-1.png" caption="Figure 1: VSAC link" %}

The reader is redirected to the VSAC login page to enter an API Key (only one login is required per session):

 {% include img.html img="vsac-2.png" caption="Figure 2: VSAC API-Key Login" %}

After successfully entering the API Key, the value set can be inspected, downloaded, etc., using the VSAC User interface, as shown in the figure below. This FHIR ValueSet resource can also be fetched using the URL `https://cts.nlm.nih.gov/fhir/ValueSet/2.16.840.1.113883.11.20.9.38`, and the FHIR ValueSet expansion using the URL `https://cts.nlm.nih.gov/fhir/ValueSet/2.16.840.1.113883.11.20.9.38/$expand`.
