description: This Requirements resources lists the US Core Responder (Server) requirements defined in the US Core Implementation Guide narrative sections. These requirements represent the regulatory, business, functional, and technical specifications that design artifacts must meet to ensure interoperability. See the [US Core Certifying System Requirements](Requirements-us-core-certifying-system.html) for the *additional requirements* for systems certifying for ASTP Health IT Certification (g(10) certification.
