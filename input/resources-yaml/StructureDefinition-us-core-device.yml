description: "The US Core Device Profile inherits from the FHIR [Device](https://hl7.org/fhir/R4/device.html) resource; refer to it for scope and usage definitions. It sets minimum expectations for the Device resource to record, search, and fetch medical and non-medical devices (for example, software or crutches). This profile meets the requirements of the U.S. Core Data for Interoperability (USCDI) *Medical Device* Data Class, including FDA Unique Device Identification (UDI) information associated with a patient's medical device(s). It specifies which core elements, extensions, vocabularies, and value sets **SHALL** be present in the resource and constrains how the elements are used and provides the floor for standards development for specific use cases promotes interoperability and adoption."
