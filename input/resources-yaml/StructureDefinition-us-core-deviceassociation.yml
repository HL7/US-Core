description: "The US Core Device Association Profile inherits from the FHIR [DeviceAssociation](https://hl7.org/fhir/R6/deviceassociation.html) resource; refer to it for scope and usage definitions. This profile meets the requirements of the U.S. Core Data for Interoperability (USCDI) by providing the association between an implantable device and a patient. It sets minimum expectations for the DeviceAssociation resource to record, search, and fetch association information for implantable devices. It specifies which core elements, extensions, vocabularies, and value sets **SHALL** be present in the resource and constrains how the elements are used. Providing the floor for standards development for specific use cases promotes interoperability and adoption."
