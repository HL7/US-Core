description: 'The US Core Immunization Profile inherits from the FHIR [Immunization](https://hl7.org/fhir/R4/immunization.html) resource; refer to it for scope and usage definitions. This profile sets minimum expectations for the Immunization resource to record, search, and fetch immunization history associated with a patient. It specifies which core elements, extensions, vocabularies, and value sets **SHALL** be present and constrains how the elements are used. Providing the floor for standards development for specific use cases promotes interoperability and adoption.'

    definition: Indicates whether the data contained in the resource was captured
      by the individual/organization which was responsible for the administration
      of the vaccine rather than as 'secondary reported' data  documented by a third
      party. A value of 'true' means this data originated with the individual/organization
      which was responsible for the administration of the vaccine.
    comment: This updated definition is adopted from the FHIR R5 Immunization resource.
