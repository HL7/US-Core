description: This profile sets minimum expectations for the Location resource for
  recording, searching, and fetching a "physical place of available services or resources."  It
  identifies which core elements, extensions, vocabularies, and value sets **SHALL**
  be present and constrains how the elements are used when using the profile.  It
  provides the floor for standards development for specific use cases to promote interoperability
  and adoption through common implementation.
