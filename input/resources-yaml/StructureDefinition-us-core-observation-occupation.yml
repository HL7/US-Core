description: The US Core Occupation Observation Profile is based upon the core FHIR
  Observation Resource and implements the US Core Data for Interoperability (USCDI)
  Occupation and Occupation Industry requirements. This profile promotes interoperability
  and adoption through common implementation by setting minimum expectations for the
  Observation resource to record, search, and fetch a patient's past or present job
  as occupation and industry, in other words, the type of work and type of business
  that compensates for work or assigns work to an unpaid worker or volunteer. In the
  context of this profile, a job is defined as a work situation, or a training or
  volunteer position held for a specified period. It identifies which core elements,
  extensions, vocabularies, and value sets **SHALL** be present and constrains the
  way the elements are used and constrains the way the elements are used when using
  the profile. It provides the floor for standards development for specific use cases.
