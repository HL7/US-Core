description: The US Core Occupation Status Observation Profile is based upon the core FHIR Observation Resource and implements the US Core Data for Interoperability (USCDI) v3 Occupation status requirements. To promote interoperability and adoption through common implementation, this profile sets minimum expectations for the Observation resource to record, search, and fetch the "Type of work of a person" and "Type of business that compensates for work or assigns work to an unpaid worker or volunteer"  associated with a patient. It identifies which core elements, extensions, vocabularies, and value sets **SHALL** be present in the resource when using this profile. It provides the floor for standards development for specific use cases.
