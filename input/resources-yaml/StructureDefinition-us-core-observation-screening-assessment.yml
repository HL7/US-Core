status: active
date: 2024-11-16
description: The US Core Observation Screening Assessment Profile inherits from the FHIR [Observation](https://hl7.org/fhir/R4/observation.html) resource; refer to it for scope and usage definitions. Beginning with US Core Version 6.0.0, this profile supersedes the US Core Observation Survey Profile (see the [Changes Between Versions](changes-between-versions.html) page for a summary of cross-version comparisons of US Core Profiles).  This profile meets the requirements of the U.S. Core Data for Interoperability (USCDI) *Health Status Assessments* Data Class. It sets the minimum expectations for the Observation Resource to record, search, and fetch observations representing the questions and responses to surveys and screening and assessment tools. For example, a social history status such as education or food insecurity or an assessment of cognitive, functional, or disability status. It can represent a single response, multiple responses, and multi-select "check all that apply" type questions. This profile specifies which core elements, extensions,  vocabularies, and value sets **SHALL** be present in the resource and constrains how the elements are used. Providing the floor for standards development for specific use cases promotes interoperability and adoption. Before reviewing this profile, implementers are encouraged to read the Screening and Assessments guidance page, which documents the process of recording responses and capturing assertions/determinations resulting from surveys and questionnaires.

      to one or more other questions. For types of answers, `Observation.performer`
      should not be specified and `Observation.derivedFrom` should reference the relevant
      Screening Response Observation(s).

    comment: "An observation may have a value if it represents an individual survey,

      have a value if it represents a multi-question or multi-select \u201Ccheck all
      that apply\u201D responses. If a value is present, the datatype for this element
      should be determined by Observation.code.  A CodeableConcept with just a text
      would be used instead of a string if the field was usually coded, or if the
      type associated with the Observation.code defines a coded value."

    comment: '"Null" or exceptional values can be represented two ways in FHIR Observations.  One
      way is to simply include them in the value set and represent the exceptions
      in the value.  The alternate way is to use the value element for actual observations
      and use the explicit dataAbsentReason element to record exceptional values.
      For a given LOINC question, if the LOINC answer list includes concepts such
      as ''unknown'' or ''not available'', they should be used for Observation.value.
      Where these concepts are not part of the value set for Observation.value, the
      Observation.dataAbsentReason can be used if necessary and appropriate.'

    short: Reference to panel members or multi-select responses or multi-select responses
    definition: Aggregate set of Observations that represent question answer pairs
      for both multi-question surveys, screenings, and assessments and multi-select
      questions.
    comment: "This grouping element is used to represent surveys, screenings, and
      assessments that group several questions together or individual questions with
      \ \u201Ccheck all that apply\u201D responses. For example in the simplest case
      a flat multi-question survey where the \"panel\" observation is the survey instrument
      itself and instead of an `Observation.value` the `hasMember` element references
      other Observation that represent the individual questions answer pairs. When
      there is a heirarchical grouping of questions, the observation \"panels\" can
      be nested. Because surveys, screenings, and assessments can be arbitrarily complex
      structurally, not all structures can be represented using this Observation grouping
      pattern."
