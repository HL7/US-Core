date: 2022-04-20
description: The US Core Observation Screening Assessment Profile meets the requirements
  of the US Core Data for Interoperability (USCDI) Assessments. To promote interoperability
  and adoption through common implementation, it sets the minimum expectations for
  the Observation Resource to record, search, and fetch observations representing
  the questions and responses to surveys and screening and assessment tools. For example,
  a social history status such as education or food insecurity or an assessment of
  the patient's cognitive, functional, or disability status. It can represent a single
  response, multiple responses, and multi-select "check all that apply" type questions.
  It identifies which core elements, extensions, vocabularies, and value sets **SHALL**
  be present in the resource and constrains the way the elements are used when using this profile. It provides the floor for standards
  development for specific use cases.

      should not be specified and `Observation.derivedFrom` should reference the relevant
      Screening Response Observation(s).

    comment: "An observation may have a value if it represents an individual survey,

      that apply\u201D responses. If a value is present, the datatype for this element
      should be determined by Observation.code.  A CodeableConcept with just a text
      would be used instead of a string if the field was usually coded, or if the
      type associated with the Observation.code defines a coded value."

    short: (USCDI) Why the result is missing
    comment: '"Null" or exceptional values can be represented two ways in FHIR Observations.  One
      way is to simply include them in the value set and represent the exceptions
      in the value.  The alternate way is to use the value element for actual observations
      and use the explicit dataAbsentReason element to record exceptional values.
      For a given LOINC question, if the LOINC answer list includes concepts such
      as ''unknown'' or ''not available'', they should be used for Observation.value.
      Where these concepts are not part of the value set for Observation.value, the
      Observation.dataAbsentReason can be used if necessary and appropriate.'

    short: (USCDI) Reference to panel members or multi-select responses or multi-select responses
    definition: Aggregate set of Observations that represent question answer pairs
      for both multi-question surveys, screenings, and assessments and multi-select
      questions.
    comment: "This grouping element is used to represent surveys, screenings, and
      assessments that group several questions together or individual questions with
      \ \u201Ccheck all that apply\u201D responses. For example in the simplest case
      a flat multi-question survey where the \"panel\" observation is the survey instrument
      itself and instead of an `Observation.value` the `hasMember` element references
      other Observation that represent the individual questions answer pairs. When
      there is a heirarchical grouping of questions, the observation \"panels\" can
      be nested. Because surveys, screenings, and assessments can be arbitrarily complex
      structurally, not all structures can be represented using this Observation grouping
      pattern."
