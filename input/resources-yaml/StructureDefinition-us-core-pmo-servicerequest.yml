description: |
  The US Core PMO ServiceRequest Profile inherits from the [FHIR ServiceRequest](https://hl7.org/fhir/R4/servicerequest.html) resource; refer to it for scope and usage definitions. This profile is principally intended to represent an order based on a PMO document and references the [US Core ADI DocumentReference Profile](StructureDefinition-us-core-adi-documentreference.html) to communicate the contents of the PMO document, such as POLST, MOLST, or other state-specific forms. PMO documents follow the patient across care settings and are typically stored as scanned images in EMRs/EHRs. Together, these two profiles satisfy the USCDI's PMO Order Data Element's intent to represent orders based on an individual's PMO. The US Core PMO ServiceRequest Profile establishes minimum expectations for recording, searching, and fetching PMO-related ServiceRequest information, specifying core elements, extensions, vocabularies, and value sets that SHALL be present to promote interoperability.

      The `ServiceRequest.code` is bound to [Portable Medical Orders - Detailed Categories and Interventions](https://vsac.nlm.nih.gov/valueset/2.16.840.1.113762.1.4.1267.35/expansion), which is comprised of code sets for each [Portable Medical Order Categories](https://vsac.nlm.nih.gov/valueset/2.16.840.1.113762.1.4.1267.34/Expansion) found in `ServiceRequest.category:us-core-pmo-category`.  For proper context, these codes **SHOULD** be aligned with the appropriate Category as follows.   - When there is no appropriate code to capture the order, plain text can be used here and in the optional `ServiceRequest.orderDetail` element.
