description: This profile sets minimum expectations for the Specimen resource to record,
  search, and fetch "substances being sampled or tested. (e.g., nasopharyngeal swab,
  whole blood, serum, urine, wound swab)" associated with a patient to promote interoperability
  and adoption through common implementation.  It identifies which core elements,
  extensions, vocabularies, and value sets **SHALL** be present in the resource and constrains the way the elements are used when
  using this profile.  It provides the floor for standards development for specific
  use cases.
