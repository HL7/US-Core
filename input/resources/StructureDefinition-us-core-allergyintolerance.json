    "description": "The US Core AllergyIntolerance Profile inherits from the FHIR [AllergyIntolerance](https://hl7.org/fhir/R4/allergyintolerance.html) resource; refer to it for scope and usage definitions. This profile sets minimum expectations for the AllergyIntolerance resource to record, search, and fetch allergies/adverse reactions associated with a patient. It specifies which core elements, extensions, vocabularies, and value sets **SHALL** be present and constrains how the elements are used. Providing the floor for standards development for specific use cases promotes interoperability and adoption.",
