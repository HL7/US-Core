This profile sets minimum expectations for the FamilyMemberHistory resource to record, search, and retrieve basic clinical information about a family member's health history that is relevant to a patient's care. It specifies which core elements, extensions, vocabularies, and value sets **SHALL** be present and constrains how the elements are used. Providing the floor for standards development for specific use cases promotes interoperability and adoption.",
