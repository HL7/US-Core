    "description": "The US Core Immunization Profile inherits from the FHIR [Immunization](https://hl7.org/fhir/R4/immunization.html) resource; refer to it for scope and usage definitions. This profile sets minimum expectations for the Immunization resource to record, search, and fetch immunization history associated with a patient. It specifies which core elements, extensions, vocabularies, and value sets **SHALL** be present and constrains how the elements are used. Providing the floor for standards development for specific use cases promotes interoperability and adoption.",
