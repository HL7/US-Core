    "description": "To promote interoperability and adoption through common implementation, the US Core Observation Survey Profile sets minimum expectations for the Observation Resource to record, search, and fetch retrieve observations that represent the questions and responses to surveys, and screening and assessment tools.  It can be used to represent a single response, multiple responses, and multi-select \u201ccheck all that apply\u201d type questions. It identifies which core elements, extensions, vocabularies, and value sets **SHALL** be present in the resource when using this profile. It provides the floor for standards development for specific use cases.",

One way is to simply include them in the value set and represent the exceptions in the value.

For a given LOINC question, if the LOINC answer list includes concepts such as 'unknown' or 'not available', they should be used for Observation.value. Where these concepts are not part of the value set for Observation.value, the Observation.dataAbsentReason can be used if necessary and appropriate.",
