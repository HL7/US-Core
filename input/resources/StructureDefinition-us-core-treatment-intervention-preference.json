    "description": "To promote interoperability and adoption through common implementation, this profile sets minimum expectations for the Observation resource to record, search, and fetch for a patient's treatment intervention preferences. It is based on the US Core Simple Profile and identifies which *additional* core elements, extensions, vocabularies, and value sets **SHALL** be present and constrains the way the elements are used when using the profile. It provides the floor for standards development for specific use cases.",
