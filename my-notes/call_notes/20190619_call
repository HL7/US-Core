Should provide some guidance - break out base url / Resource / id  ( issues with this)
Best to keep same id  but not always possible
DSTU2 - R4 identifiers not always same.

Whether a version independent identifier ( business identifier ) would be better
e.g. a MRN

See FHIR for guidance  - will review.

See scopes - typically need to reauthorized if go from DSTU2 - R4.

one application: refresh tokens fail if go from 2 to 4.

effectively developer need to start fresh with new reg to go from 2 to 4

upshot is keep both registration for 2 to 4  (or context version)

brings up more questions:

separate call:

? how to convey that changes are coming.
