### Endpoint Discoverability

- client should know what version they are dealing with without having inspect metadata on each endpoint.
- existing mechanisms confusing
- Server SHOULD make explicit which version of Argo/US Core on their FHIR endpoint
   - e.g., "DSTU2" or â€œR4" path component or separate files based on version
- In future coalesce on single method

### No Guarantee that Resource IDs are Preserved between DSTU-2 and R4

- stable ids = best practice
- Can not make assume ids will be the same
  - Clients need to deduplicate and map across versions

### Expectation that DSTU2 Data is Preserved in R4

- Resource Types SHALL be the same in R4 as DSTU2.
    - r3-r4 resources migration - change name, careteam, medicationrequests
- SHALL represent the *same** data in R4 as DSTU2.  ( e.g patient Rhonda Jones is available on both)
- Data SHALL not be degraded between versions.

### Authorization Across Versions

- Separate authorization is required
   - No expectation that DSTU2 authorizations will work on R4 endpoints and hence the need to reauthorize when migrating between versions.
      - Maintaining the same auth server for both endpoints so that the refresh token is valid for the R4 endpoint as well may be possible but not in scope.
- The new endpoint will bring additional data types and added scopes

### multiple patients

- for both provider and patient apps
  - example scenarios:
    provider discover all my patients with allergy to x
    patient/consumer - see if have access to my children

- propose search *without* patients:
   - only fetch those authorized to see.

      - patient level scopes:  fetch all patients - only see 1 patient

      - users level scopes:  fetch all patients - only those authorized to see  (e.g., all patients for provider y)

clarification on multiple patients  - Josh to ask Steve.
