#### workflow

#### 1. Editing Narrative: Pagecontent, Includes, or Intro Or Notes Files

   1. update tracker summary in package-list.yml
      - Change summary text if needed to clarify changes
      - update rel-address to reference the section in the spec
   1. make changes to Text
      1. discuss issue with applying a tracker on the argonaut Zulip stream

   1. text highlighting (add class and id to section)

       in markdown  add `{:.new-content #FHIR-NNNN}`  where NNNN = tracker number:
        - for a paragraph in the line after the text block
        - if a list item add it at the beginning of the item after the '-' or '1.'

        in html add `<div class="new-content" id="FHIR-NNNN"> ... </div>`
          - for more than single block use html
          - if in doubt use html

    1. run build only (no sushi)
        1.  rename `input/fsh` to `input/_fsh`
        1.  run ig-publisher  (remember to update to latest version)
        1.  rename `input/_fsh` to `input/fsh`

    1. Check rendered output
    1. commit and push to github
        1.  rename `input/fsh` to `input/_fsh`
        1.  commit and push to github
            ~~~bash
                > git commit -am "commit message"
                > git push
            ~~~
        1.  rename `input/_fsh` to `input/fsh`
