introduction: >-
  The US Core Profiles were originally designed to meet the 2015 Edition
  certification criterion for Patient Selection 170.315(g)(7), and Application
  Access – Data Category Request 170.315(g)(8). They were created for each item
  in the 2015 Edition Common Clinical Data Set (CCDS). The Location,
  Organization, and Practitioner Profiles are not called out specifically in the
  certification criteria but are included because they are directly referenced
  by other profiles. The US Core Profiles are informed by the prior Data Access
  Framework and the [Argonaut DSTU2](http://www.fhir.org/guides/argonaut/r2/)
  Implementation Guides. However, the profiles here are stand alone and include
  new requirements from the latest proposed ONC [U.S. Core Data for
  Interoperability
  (USCDI)](https://www.healthit.gov/isa/us-core-data-interoperability-uscdi) and
  includes all the [API Resource Collection in Health
  (ARCH)](https://www.healthit.gov/isa/api-resource-collection-health-arch)
  resources.  This implementation guide forms the foundation to build future US
  Realm FHIR implementation guides and its content will continue to grow to meet
  the needs of US implementers.

      In order meet the proposed *ONC U.S. Core Data for Interoperability**
      (USCDI) regulatory requirements for access to patient data, this STU
      Update of the US Core Implementation Guide has added new content.
      Structured Documents and the [Argonaut Project
      Team](https://argonautwiki.hl7.org/Argonaut_2019_Projects#Argonaut_R4)
      have spent the last several months reviewing, testing and providing
      invaluable feedback on these and other topics including most notably:

      1) A US Core Provenance Profile and Basic Provenance guidance on fetching
      Provenance for patient data.

      2) Medication List Guidance for fetching a patient's medications

      3) Recasting the US Core Device profile into a US Core Implantable Device
      Profile

      4) A US Core spO2 by US Core Pulse Oximetry Profile

      5) Updated search to support requiring search by multiple statuses

      6) Guidance when the source has no data

      7) General guidelines and considerations for DSTU2 to R4 Conversion

      8) Guidance for language support

      9) Considerations for fetching data for multiple patients]

      10) Future considerations for times offset and timezone guidelines

      11) Future Considerations for writing and updating data

      12) Update security pageto reflect current testing.

      13) Clarify definition of MustSupport to reflect the intent that the
      server must be able to populate a MustSupport element in order to claim
      conformance to the profile.

      14) Expanding bindings for Procedure and Condition codes for quality
      measures and other purposes.
