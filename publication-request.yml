# introduction: 'The International Patient Access implementation guide (IPA) defines a minimal, base set of FHIR profiles and FHIR RESTful interactions. In addition, IPA specifies the use of SMART on FHIR for authentication and authorization. It can be used as-is or as a foundation for developing national standards to enable patients access to their healthcare data via FHIR-enabled patient-facing apps. The IPA Profiles are informed by a range of national base FHIR specifications circa 2022. As a foundational guide with an international focus, its content will continue to grow to meet global needs.'
