  <p>﻿This profile sets minimum expectations for the <a href="http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/observation.html">Observation</a> resource to record, search, and fetch retrieve observations that represent the questions and responses to form/survey and assessment tools such as the <a href="https://www.nachc.org/research-and-data/prapare/">Protocol for Responding to and Assessing Patients’ Assets, Risks, and Experiences (PRAPARE) Survey</a>. This profile encompasses single, multipart, and derived responses.  It identifies which core elements, extensions, vocabularies and value sets <strong>SHALL</strong> be present in the resource when using this profile.  These observations are distinct from observations representing individual clinical assessments made by an individual about a patient’s social history and not derived from an assessment tool or survey. These types of observations should use the <a href="StructureDefinition-us-core-observation-social-history-assessment.html">US Core Social History Assessment Observation Profile</a> instead.</p>

  <p><strong>Example Usage Scenarios:</strong></p>

  <p>The following are example usage scenarios for the US Core-Results profile:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Query for survey screening results for a patient.</li>
    <li><a href="future-of-US-core.html#future-candidate-requirements-under-consideration">Record or update</a> screening results results belonging to a Patient</li>
  </ul>

  <h3 id="mandatory-and-must-support-data-elements">Mandatory and Must Support Data Elements</h3>

  <p>The following data-elements must always be present (<a href="conformance-expectations.html#mandatory-elements">Mandatory</a> definition]) or must be supported if the data is present in the sending system (<a href="conformance-expectations.html#must-support-elements">Must Support</a> definition). They are presented below in a simple human-readable explanation.  Profile specific guidance and examples are provided as well.  The <a href="#profile">Formal Profile Definition</a> below provides the  formal summary, definitions, and  terminology requirements.</p>

  <p><strong>Each Observation must have:</strong></p>

  <ol>
    <li>a status</li>
    <li>a category code of ‘survey’</li>
    <li>a <a href="http://loinc.org">LOINC</a> code, if available, which tells you the survey question</li>
    <li>a patient</li>
  </ol>

  <p><strong>Each Observation must support:</strong></p>

  <ol>
    <li>a time indicating when survey was taken</li>
    <li>who answered the questions</li>
    <li>the answer or a reason why the data is absent*
      <ul>
        <li>if the result value is a numeric quantity, a standard <a href="http://unitsofmeasure.org">UCUM</a> unit is required</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>related questionnaire responses or observations that this observation is made from</li>
    <li>component results</li>
  </ol>

  <div class="note-to-balloters">
    <p>We are seeking feedback on the inclusion of Observation.component as a Must Support element for systems to record multiple answers for a screening question in a single Observation.  Based on how broadly this is supported in current implementations, we may remove the constraint on Observation.component and recommend multiple Observations.</p>
  </div>

  <p><strong>Profile specific implementation guidance:</strong></p>

  <ul>
    <li>See <a href="sdoh.html">SDOH Guidance</a> for how this profile can used to represent SDOH assessments.</li>
    <li>For questions represented in <code class="highlighter-rouge">Observation.code</code> (e.g., LOINC) that specify “check all that apply”, the question should be used for <code class="highlighter-rouge">Observation.code</code> and for <code class="highlighter-rouge">Observation.component.code</code>. For “check all that apply” questions, the answers (regardless of whether one or more are selected) should only be represented using <code class="highlighter-rouge">Observation.component.value</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">Observation.value</code> should be empty.</li>
    <li>An Observation without a value, <strong>SHALL</strong> include a reason why the data is absent <em>unless</em> there are 1) component observations, or 2) reporting vital signs panel components using  <code class="highlighter-rouge">Observation.hasMember</code>.
      <ul>
        <li>For Further guidance see the <a href="http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/observation.html#obsgrouping">Observation Grouping</a> section in FHIR Specification.</li>
        <li>*Systems that never provide an observation without a value are not required to support <code class="highlighter-rouge">Observation.dataAbsentReason</code>.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li class="new-content">An <code class="highlighter-rouge">Observation.component</code> without a value, <strong>SHALL</strong> include a reason why the data is absent.
      <ul>
        <li>*Systems that never provide an component observation without a component value are not required to support <code class="highlighter-rouge">Observation.component.dataAbsentReason</code>.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
