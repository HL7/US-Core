<p>﻿This profile sets minimum expectations for the <a href="http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/condition.html">Condition</a> resource to record, search, and fetch a  list of conditions associated with a patient. It identifies which core elements, extensions, vocabularies and value sets <strong>SHALL</strong> be present in the resource when using this profile.</p>

<p><strong>Example Usage Scenarios:</strong></p>

<p>The following are example usage scenarios for the US Core Condition profile:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Query for a Patient’s current or historical conditions</li>
  <li><a href="future-of-US-core.html#future-candidate-requirements-under-consideration">Record or update</a> a Patient’s conditions</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="mandatory-and-must-support-data-elements">Mandatory and Must Support Data Elements</h3>

<p>The following data-elements must always be present (<a href="conformance-expectations.html#mandatory-elements">Mandatory</a> definition]) or must be supported if the data is present in the sending system (<a href="conformance-expectations.html#must-support-elements">Must Support</a> definition). They are presented below in a simple human-readable explanation.  Profile specific guidance and examples are provided as well.  The <a href="#profile">Formal Profile Definition</a> below provides the  formal summary, definitions, and  terminology requirements.</p>

<p><strong>Each Condition must have:</strong></p>

<ol>
  <li>a status of the condition*</li>
  <li>a category</li>
  <li>a code that identifies the condition</li>
  <li>a patient</li>
</ol>

<p>*The status element has the following constraints: SHALL be present if verification status is not entered-in-error and SHALL NOT be present if verification Status is entered-in-error.</p>

<p><strong>Each Condition must support:</strong></p>

<ol>
  <li>a verification status</li>
  <li class="new-content">an encounter</li>
  <li class="new-content">a date of diagnosis*</li>
  <li class="new-content">a date of resolution</li>
  <li class="new-content">a date when recorded*</li>
</ol>

<p class="new-content">*See the next section for how the date of diagnosis is represented in this Profile.</p>

<p><strong>Profile specific implementation guidance:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>The <a href="ValueSet-us-core-condition-category.html">US Core Condition Category Codes</a> support the separate types of conditions so API consumers can separate health concerns, problems, and encounter diagnoses.</li>
  <li>The 2015 Certification rule requires the use of SNOMED CT for problem list entries. Following the rules for [required] binding to coded data types, ICD or other local codes can be used as translations to SNOMED CT.</li>
  <li>The <a href="ValueSet-us-core-condition-code.html">US Core Condition Code</a> supports ICD-9-CM for historical purposes only. ICD-10-CM is available and may be used as the primary code for current encounter diagnoses.</li>
  <li>To search for an encounter diagnosis, query for Conditions that reference the Encounter of interest and have a category of <code class="highlighter-rouge">encounter-diagnosis</code>.  An example search is shown in the <a href="#search">Quick Start</a> section below.
    <ul>
      <li class="new-content">When <code class="highlighter-rouge">Condition.category</code> is “encounter-diagnosis” the encounter, <strong>SHOULD</strong> be referenced in <code class="highlighter-rouge">Condition.encounter</code>.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li class="new-content">See <a href="sdoh.html">SDOH Guidance</a> for more information when exchanging Social Determinants of Health (SDOH) Conditions/Health Concerns.</li>
  <li class="new-content">There is no single element in Condition that represents the date of diagnosis. It may be the <a href="http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/extension-condition-asserteddate.html">assertedDate Extension</a>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">Condition.onsetDate</code>, or <code class="highlighter-rouge">Condition.recordedDate</code>.
    <ul>
      <li>Although all three are marked as must support, the server is not required to support all.</li>
      <li>A server <strong>SHALL</strong> support <code class="highlighter-rouge">Condition.recordedDate</code>.</li>
      <li>A server <strong>SHALL</strong> support at least one of <a href="http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/extension-condition-asserteddate.html">assertedDate Extension</a> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">Condition.onsetDate</code>. A server may support both, which means they support all 3 locations.</li>
      <li>The client application <strong>SHALL</strong> support all three elements.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
