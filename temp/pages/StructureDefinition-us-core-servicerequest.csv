Otherwise when referencing  *DiagnosticReport*  it should contain a finding  in `DiagnosticReport.conclusion` and/or `DiagnosticReport.conclusionCode`.   When using a reference to *DocumentReference*, the target document should contain clear findings language providing the relevant reason for this service request.
