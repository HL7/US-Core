﻿This profile sets minimum expectations for the [Condition] resource to record, search, and fetch a  list of conditions associated with a patient. It identifies which core elements, extensions, vocabularies and value sets **SHALL** be present in the resource when using this profile.

**Example Usage Scenarios:**

The following are example usage scenarios for the US Core Condition profile:

-   Query for a Patient’s current or historical conditions
-   [Record or update] a Patient’s conditions

### Mandatory and Must Support Data Elements


The following data-elements must always be present ([Mandatory] definition]) or must be supported if the data is present in the sending system ([Must Support] definition). They are presented below in a simple human-readable explanation.  Profile specific guidance and examples are provided as well.  The [Formal Profile Definition] below provides the  formal summary, definitions, and  terminology requirements.  

**Each Condition must have:**

1.  a status of the condition*
1.  a category
1.  a code that identifies the condition
1.  a patient

*The status element has the following constraints: SHALL be present if verification status is not entered-in-error and SHALL NOT be present if verification Status is entered-in-error.

**Each Condition must support:**

1.  a verification status
2.  {:.new-content}an encounter
3.  {:.new-content}a date of diagnosis*
5.  {:.new-content}a date of resolution
6.  {:.new-content}a date when recorded*

*See the next section for how the date of diagnosis is represented in this Profile.
{:.new-content}

**Profile specific implementation guidance:**

* The [US Core Condition Category Codes] support the separate types of conditions so API consumers can separate health concerns, problems, and encounter diagnoses.
* The 2015 Certification rule requires the use of SNOMED CT for problem list entries. Following the rules for [required] binding to coded data types, ICD or other local codes can be used as translations to SNOMED CT.
* The [US Core Condition Code] supports ICD-9-CM for historical purposes only. ICD-10-CM is available and may be used as the primary code for current encounter diagnoses.
* To search for an encounter diagnosis, query for Conditions that reference the Encounter of interest and have a category of `encounter-diagnosis`.  An example search is shown in the [Quick Start](#search) section below.
    * {:.new-content}When `Condition.category` is "encounter-diagnosis" the encounter, **SHOULD** be referenced in `Condition.encounter`.
* {:.new-content}See [SDOH Guidance] for more information when exchanging Social Determinants of Health (SDOH) Conditions/Health Concerns.
* {:.new-content}There is no single element in Condition that represents the date of diagnosis. It may be the [assertedDate Extension], `Condition.onsetDate`, or `Condition.recordedDate`.
    * Although all three are marked as must support, the server is not required to support all.
	* A server **SHALL** support `Condition.recordedDate`.
    * A server **SHALL** support at least one of [assertedDate Extension] and `Condition.onsetDate`. A server may support both, which means they support all 3 locations.
    * The client application **SHALL** support all three elements.

### Examples
