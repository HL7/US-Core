<h3>Logical Definition (CLD)</h3>
<div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><ul><li>Include these codes as defined in <a href="http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/codesystem-observation-status.html"><code>http://hl7.org/fhir/observation-status</code></a><table class="none"><tr><td style="white-space:nowrap"><b>Code</b></td><td><b>Display</b></td><td><b>Definition</b></td></tr><tr><td><a href="http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/codesystem-observation-status.html#observation-status-final">final</a></td><td>Final</td><td>The observation is complete and there are no further actions needed. Additional information such "released", "signed", etc would be represented using [Provenance](provenance.html) which provides not only the act but also the actors and dates and other related data. These act states would be associated with an observation status of `preliminary` until they are all completed and then a status of `final` would be applied.</td></tr><tr><td><a href="http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/codesystem-observation-status.html#observation-status-entered-in-error">entered-in-error</a></td><td>Entered in Error</td><td>The observation has been withdrawn following previous final release.  This electronic record should never have existed, though it is possible that real-world decisions were based on it. (If real-world activity has occurred, the status should be "cancelled" rather than "entered-in-error".).</td></tr></table></li></ul></div></body>
