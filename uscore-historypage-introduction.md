  The US Core Implementation Guide defines the minimum set of FHIR RESTful
  interactions for each of the US Core Profiles to access patient data. The Data
  Access Framework and the [Argonaut
  DSTU2](https://www.fhir.org/guides/argonaut/r2/) guides initially formed the
  basis for US Core. The Profiles are updated annually to support the latest
  requirements from [ASTP U.S. Core Data for Interoperability
  (USCDI)](https://www.healthit.gov/isa/united-states-core-data-interoperability-uscdi).
  Fixes required between releases are managed by the [Cross Group Project patch
  process](https://confluence.hl7.org/display/CGP/US+Core+%27Patch%27+Process)
  with approved patches on this [HL7 Confluence
  page](https://confluence.hl7.org/display/CGP/Approved+Patches+and+Additional+Guidance).
  For a summary of significant changes and a detailed list of the changes
  between versions, see the [Change Notes](
